Float16 describes stored parameters; input remains float32 and output int64.
Normalization is inside the network. The output is a segmentation map. The Java
decoder combines it with the original grayscale page to estimate pitches and timing.
The checkpoint retains an auxiliary note-centre head. It is excluded from the default
TFLite model and is not a reliable substitute for the decoder's note checks.

## Training and reuse

The model continues our own randomly initialized v1–v3 lineage through recorded
development checkpoints. No external pretrained OMR weights, distillation targets,
downloaded score datasets, commercial sheets or phone images were used for training.
Ten original generated corpora provide notation examples; procedural augmentations
add appearance variation and nearby marks. Training used an RTX 2080 SUPER.

All 32 exported calibration inputs were matched to original synthetic training-page
crops. `weights.npz` is losslessly compressed; every array matches the original
export. `best.pt` contains the identical selected model tensors with private paths,
optimizer and scaler state removed. See [lineage.json](lineage.json),
[artifacts.json](artifacts.json) and [training.json](training.json).

The [training guide](../training/README.md) covers loading, fine-tuning and export.
These tools support further training; they do not reproduce every historical corpus
generation and optimizer update. Bit-for-bit retraining is not claimed. The earlier
v3 TFLite remains in `models/`; release v0.1.0 retains its checkpoint and package.

## Evaluation and limitations

Candidate24 improved clean and broad development segmentation scores over candidate23.
Dim/paper appearance mean IoU declined from 0.73073 to 0.71354, and the ledger stratum
declined slightly. These are repeated development measurements, not independent
full-page accuracy. The new raw-model held-out split remains unevaluated.

The release also uses manually reviewed pitch anchors on real scores. Coverage ranges
from short passages to full pages; it does not establish whole-library accuracy or
cover all extra notes, rhythms and repeats. Counts and scopes are in
[evaluation.json](evaluation.json). Private score images and coordinates are not distributed.

Errors remain in accidentals, hollow heads, small notation, complex polyphony, faint
scans, ties and timing. The interpreter can still omit or invent notes. MIDI is a
preview; check results against the printed page. No general accuracy percentage or
state-of-the-art claim is made.

The code and weights may be modified and used in commercial, closed-source products
under Apache-2.0. Preserve the license and applicable notices when redistributing.
