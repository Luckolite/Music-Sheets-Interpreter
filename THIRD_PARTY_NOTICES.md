# Third-party notices

The runtime wheel and Java JAR contain our original code, our independent weights,
and the recognition-only glyph rasters described below. Other dependencies are
installed separately, not copied into the wheel or JAR. Preserve their
complete upstream notices if you redistribute them as part of a larger application.

Dependency licenses are not replaced by this project's Apache license. In particular,
an upstream package's headline license is not a substitute for its complete binary
distribution notices.

## Bundled recognition glyphs

The JAR includes 27 small grayscale templates: nine dynamic symbols rendered from
Bravura, and nine ornament/auxiliary-accidental symbols rendered in both Bravura and
Leland. They are individual glyph samples, not score excerpts or font binaries.
Bravura is copyright Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH; Leland is copyright
MuseScore BVBA. Both retain SIL OFL 1.1. Their complete notices and exact per-file
SHA-256 checksums are packaged beside the templates under
`io/github/luckolite/interpreter/glyphs/` and kept in
[`java/src/main/resources/io/github/luckolite/interpreter/glyphs/`](java/src/main/resources/io/github/luckolite/interpreter/glyphs/).
These materials are not relicensed under Apache-2.0. The build verifies their
manifest and includes all resource bytes in the decoder fingerprint.

The desktop adapter also renders `tr`/`tr.` in the user's JDK logical serif font
at runtime; those generated candidates are not bundled font assets.

## Training fonts

The bundled, unmodified `training/fonts/NotoSerif.ttf` is copyright 2022 The Noto
Project Authors and is distributed under SIL OFL 1.1. Its complete notice is
[NOTO-SERIF-OFL.txt](training/fonts/NOTO-SERIF-OFL.txt).

The unmodified `java/assets/Bravura.otf` is copyright Steinberg Media Technologies
GmbH and distributed under SIL OFL 1.1 for optional desktop meter matching. Its
complete notice is [Bravura-OFL.txt](java/assets/Bravura-OFL.txt). The runtime wheel
does not bundle this font. Training also uses music glyphs from the pinned Verovio
installation; their notices are [BRAVURA-OFL.txt](training/fonts/BRAVURA-OFL.txt)
and [LELAND-OFL.txt](training/fonts/LELAND-OFL.txt).

Generated score images in `examples/` are newly authored exercises. No commercial
sheet-music pages, recordings, pretrained third-party OMR models or Google OCR assets
are included.
